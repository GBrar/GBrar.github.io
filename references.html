			<p>The styling of the is very clean, the layout, it is very efficient at getting detailed information when you click 	on a particular actor -> their bond movie history comes up. but it doesnt tell the year it was made(mine does).
				i didnt recognize <em>article</em> its purpose seems like <em>fieldset</em>.
			</p>
			<p>I think to get my website to be better is to improve styling and layout. along with using Ruby and Javascript for functionality.</p>
